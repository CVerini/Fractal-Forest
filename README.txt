Description:

This is a two-parts project that tackle a classical challenge in computer graphics: generating art using fractals.

Refer to the "Project 7 Resource Guide," for complete instructions.

Submit the following to LoudCloud;

Documentation:

Theoretical background, mathematical concepts, programming concepts, esthetic decisions, etc.
All the grammars defined, the reasoning for each, and expected use, with two examples
A detailed algorithm (flowchart) depicting the logic of your approach to generating a forest
Code:

Complete, commented code that implements the L-Systems
Complete, commented code that implements the PolyCylinder
All data files used, including all grammars stored in separate files
Readme.txt file, including instructions for running and software requirements
Screenshot showings the execution of the code
Submit the following to GitHub:

Readme.md (Markdown format is required)
Complete commented code required to run this project, including the implementation of L-Systems and PolyCylinder
Prepare the documentation according to the guidelines found in the APA Style Guide, located in the Student Success Center. A cover page is required as well as clear sections that detail all aspects of this project.

On a separate page, include references (book, articles, web sites, tutorials, etc.) and the URL of your private BitBucket repository for the project.

Refer to "Project 6: Fractal Art Assessment Guide," prior to beginning the assignment to become familiar with the expectations for successful completion.

You are not required to submit this assignment to LopesWrite.

PART II - Fractal Forest

Description:

This is a continuation of Project 6, in which you will render the fractal forest using the L-Systems, grammar, and PolyCylinders previously defined. In this project (the second and last in this sequence) you will use HTML, JavaScript, and primarily WebGL to render a forest.

Refer to the "Project 7 Resource Guide," for complete instructions.
